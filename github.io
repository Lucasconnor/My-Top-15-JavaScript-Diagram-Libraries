# My-Top-15-JavaScript-Diagram-Libraries

JavaScript has proved to be a powerful language for web development. With the help of it, developers create interactive sites and applications that easily grab users' attention. There are hundreds of various JS libraries either available in the open-source or those offering commercial licenses. It is easy to get lost while making a choice not only for junior developers but also for senior experienced programmers.
 
To make the choice easier, we have compiled a list of the JS libraries offering the feature of creating diagrams. A diagram is a great solution when there is a need to visualize complicated data. With a diagram, the information is perceived more effectively. Various types of diagrams allow users to show the logic of a process, the correlation between some indicators, a hierarchy of the structure, and so on. Let's take a closer look at the most remarkable of them.
 
 JS Diagram Library

We start from the one that has appeared recently. It is a solution from the Webix JS Library. The list of diagram types is wide. It includes block diagrams, decision trees, fish bone diagrams, Venn diagrams, and others. Developers can choose among offered shapes of the blocks or create the shapes themselves. All the settings can be set automatically, or customized according to the needs of the project. The library supports all modern browsers, it is integrated with jQuery, Angular, Vue, React. Besides, the diagram is ready to operate on touch screens.
 
D3.js

This library is a giant in data visualization and animation. It is fascinating even just to look through the various charts and diagrams offered on their home page. However, the library is heavy, and the documentation is complicated. It offers over 1000 approaches to help you with your idea, which is confusing. But once you get it, you will feel all-mighty. The learning curve is steep and requires qualitative time. The tool uses SVG, Canvas, and HTML.
 
C3.js

Here comes the solution to the above-mentioned difficulties. If you are interested in D3.js, but the complexity and the weight of it discourage you from testing, C3.js is the way out. With the C3.js library, your charts will be built with D3.js underneath, but the process of code writing will be shorter and easier. The charts created are easily customizable, and a few callbacks control the behavior of the charts even after they have been rendered.
 
DHTMLX Diagram

This is a lightweight component, which allows to easily add diagrams and charts to any project. Shapes of the blocks, links, and connectors can be used from the offered options or customized. The solution gets along with all modern browsers and most of the popular frameworks. One more nice function of the library is a built-in editor, which simplifies the process of creating diagrams and makes it faster.
 
Google Charts

Now we turn to something obvious. Google knows everything, and diagrams are no exception. This is the easiest way to create a diagram, in case the project requires simple and clear visualization. Besides, the solution is free, so it is a worthy option for start-ups and those gaining experience. The information is sent via HTTP requests, and Google provides developers with a diagram in PNG format as a reply. Different chart formats are supported.
 
GoJS

This is a framework for building interactive diagrams in JavaScript and TypeScript. There are more than 150 samples that help to get started with interactive diagrams, such as BPMN, flowcharts, state charts, visual trees, Sankey, and data flows. The documentation is detailed enough, so the learning curve should not be too steep.
 
MxGraph

It is a client-side JS diagramming library. It uses SVG and HTML to render the models. A nice thing about this solution is that it does not use a third-party software, there are no plugins required, so it can easily be integrated into any environment. The client software is written in JS, the backend is written in various languages, which makes the solution universal.
 
Kendo UI Diagramming

From this one on, we will look through the similar solutions of the diagram widgets and controls of competing JS libraries. This control supports three types of diagrams, different chart types, including bar charts, pie charts, line charts. Besides, the solution boasts convenient zooming within the limited space to easily move in and out between high-level views and details. Kendo UI supports Angular, React, and jQuery environments. Kendo UI is a good option if you need to get the job done on time and with responsive tech support.
 
Syncfusion Diagram

Syncfusion is one more JS library with numerous controls and components. Regarding diagrams, it supports creating flowcharts, organizational charts, mind maps, and BPMN charts either through code or a visual interface. The standard flowchart shapes are provided. An automatic algorithm helps to arrange the parent and child positions in the organizational charts. Automatic placement is also a feature of mind maps. Drag-n-drop, resizing, and rotation via touchscreen are other fascinating options of this solution.
 
DevExtreme Diagram

This control is available as a jQuery plugin and can be bound to external data. The Diagram includes more than 40 resizable shapes, which can be dragged and dropped onto a page. All the shapes and connectors are highly customizable. You can specify the type, background image, default size, text, connection points, and other settings. All the diagrams are easily adapted to narrow screens.
 
Visual Paradigm

This product is a bit different from others. It is an online platform for online diagramming. The platform includes a powerful diagram editor and a workspace to access and share the work done. The cloud workspace is a great opportunity for a team to cooperate on the same project. The platform offers more than 2000 examples of diagrams. For the sphere of education, the platform provides its help for free.
 
CrossUI

An application builder that creates various solutions without coding. Interactive apps can be built even by those who are far from software development. This may be a good option for start-ups. With CrossUI, it is possible to create charts and diagrams, as well as prototypes, IoT structures, interaction tools, and whatnot. There are also such tools as embedded designer and code editor that facilitate the process of app development.
 
Mindfusion

This tool uses the HTML5 Canvas element for drawing. The diagrams are compatible with any device. With the Mindfusion library, it is possible to create workflow diagrams, schemes, family trees, graphs. Connectors are also offered in various types. The documentation is of great help, as it is very detailed. The automatic layout algorithms are also available.
 
Diagram.js

We finish up with the core libraries for creating JS diagrams. This solution is used for building business process models, decision models, and case plan models.
 
State.js

This solution is focused on hierarchical state machines. It is developed in TypeScript and transferred to JavaScript; you can use it in either language. It hasnâ€™t been updated in a while though.
 
Conclusion
The variety of possibilities for building a JS diagram is overwhelming. They differ in features, weight, and design. Developers can choose from huge giant libraries of any imaginable diagram to quite limited solutions, focused on the most common tasks. The final choice should be made after careful examination of the possibilities and a clear understanding of the requirements.
